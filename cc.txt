1. How many buckets can you create in Amazon S3?
•	By default, you can create 100 buckets per AWS account. However, this limit can be increased by requesting an AWS service limit increase.
________________________________________
2. What do you understand about the standard bucket in Amazon S3?
•	A standard bucket in Amazon S3 refers to a storage bucket that uses the S3 Standard storage class.
•	Key Features:
o	High durability (99.999999999% or "11 nines").
o	Low-latency and high throughput.
o	Suitable for frequently accessed data.
o	Default storage class in S3.

3. What is a Private Cloud and what is a Public Cloud?
•	Private Cloud:
o	A cloud computing environment exclusively used by a single organization.
o	Hosted on-premises or by a third-party provider.
o	Example: VMware Cloud, OpenStack, AWS Outposts.
•	Public Cloud:
o	A cloud service provided by third-party providers over the internet.
o	Shared infrastructure among multiple customers.
o	Example: AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform.

4. What is the difference between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS?
Feature	IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)	PaaS (Platform as a Service)	SaaS (Software as a Service)
Definition	Provides virtualized computing resources.	Provides a platform for development and deployment.	Provides ready-to-use applications over the internet.
Control	Users manage OS, applications, and networking.	Users manage applications only.	Users have no control over backend infrastructure.
Example	AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine.	AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine.	Gmail, Google Drive, Microsoft 365.

5. Difference between Disaster Recovery and Data Center?
•	Disaster Recovery (DR):
o	A strategy to restore IT infrastructure and data after a failure or disaster.
o	Can involve backups, failover systems, replication, and cloud-based recovery.
•	Data Center:
o	A physical location housing servers, storage, and networking equipment.
o	May or may not have disaster recovery mechanisms.
Example:
•	A company without DR may lose all data if its data center is destroyed.
•	A company with DR can restore operations using cloud backups.

7. Difference between On-Premises Cloud, Public Cloud, and Private Cloud
Feature	On-Premises Cloud	Public Cloud	Private Cloud
Infrastructure	Managed internally	Managed by a provider	Dedicated to one organization
Cost	High (CapEx)	Pay-as-you-go (OpEx)	High setup cost but low OpEx
Scalability	Limited	Highly Scalable	Scalable but requires hardware upgrades
Security	High	Moderate	High
Example	Company data centers	AWS, Azure	OpenStack, VMware Cloud

8. What is a Distributed System?
•	A distributed system is a network of independent computers that work together as a single system.
•	Used in cloud computing, microservices, and big data processing.
Examples:
•	Google Search (runs across many data centers).
•	Hadoop (distributed data processing).

9. What is Cloud Computing?
•	Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services (such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics) over the internet.
•	Characteristics:
o	On-demand self-service.
o	Broad network access.
o	Resource pooling.
o	Rapid elasticity.
o	Pay-as-you-go pricing.
Examples of Cloud Providers: AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure.
